long-title: Win a Great British Break
intro: >
  <p class="text--xxl">Reconnect with a loved one on a Great British Break. Perched on a cliffside overlooking the beautiful Devon coast, Gara Rock makes for a stylish getaway, with boutique appointments throughout. </p>
  <p class="text--xxl">Spend three nights in the gorgeous Secret Suite, with a private terrace overlooking the sea and your very own hot tub for those sunset bubbles. It’s as private as you’d want, separate from the main hotel with its very own clifftop position for stunning views all round. </p>
  <p class="text--xxl">To make things even more effortless, enjoy breakfast each morning and a two-course dinner with a bottle of wine on one night. Here’s your chance to reconnect with a loved one on this unmissable getaway. Brought to you by TouchNote and Secret Escapes, enter now for your chance to win!</p>
